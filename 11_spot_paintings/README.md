# 🎨 Spot Painting Generator

This Python program generates artwork inspired by **Damien Hirst's "Spot Paintings"** using the `turtle` 
graphics library and colors extracted from an image.

## 🖼️ How It Works

- Colors are extracted from an input image (`replica.png`) using the `colorgram` library.
- 100 colored dots (10x10 grid) are drawn on the screen using random colors from the palette.
- The style mimics Hirst’s conceptual art: evenly spaced, vibrant dots on a white background.
