# 🐍 Snake Game (Turtle Graphics)

Welcome to my version of the classic **Snake Game** 
built with Python using the `turtle` module! 
This project was created as a fun and educational way to practice object-oriented programming 
and event-driven design.

## 🎮 Gameplay

- Control the snake using the arrow keys (`↑ ↓ ← →`)
- Eat the blue food to grow longer and earn points
- The game ends when:
  - You collide with a wall
  - You run into your own tail

## 🧩 Features

- Snake movement and turning
- Food that randomly appears
- Score tracking
- Game Over message on collision
