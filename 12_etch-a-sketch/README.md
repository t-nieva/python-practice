# 🖍️ Etch-a-Sketch with Turtle

This is a simple Etch-a-Sketch mini project created using Python's built-in `turtle` graphics module. 
It allows you to control a turtle (pen) on the screen using keyboard keys to draw, turn, and clear 
the canvas — just like the classic toy!

## 🎮 Controls

- `W` - Move forward
- `S` - Move backward
- `A` - Turn left
- `D` - Turn right
- `C` - Clear the screen and return to the center
