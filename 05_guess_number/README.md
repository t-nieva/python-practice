# ðŸŽ¯ Number Guessing Game

Welcome to the **Number Guessing Game** â€“ a simple console-based Python game where you try to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.

## ðŸ“‹ How to Play

1. When the game starts, youâ€™ll be prompted to choose a difficulty level: `easy` or `hard`.
2. The program will randomly choose a number between 1 and 100.
3. Your goal is to guess that number within a limited number of attempts:
   - **Easy**: 10 attempts
   - **Hard**: 5 attempts
4. After each guess, the game will tell you whether your guess was too high or too low.
5. The game ends when you guess the number or run out of attempts.
