# 🗺️ U.S. States Game (Python Turtle Project)

This is an interactive game built with Python's Turtle and Pandas libraries. 
The goal is to correctly guess all 50 U.S. states by name. 
Each correct guess is marked on the U.S. map.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Run the program.
2. A map of the United States will appear.
3. You'll be prompted to enter the name of a U.S. state.
4. If correct, the state name will appear on the map.
5. The game continues until:
   - You guess all 50 states, or
   - You type **Exit** to end the game early.

At the end, a file called `states_to_learn.csv` will be created 
containing the states you didn’t guess yet — a great way to study!
