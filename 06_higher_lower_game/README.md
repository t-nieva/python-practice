# ðŸŽ¯ Higher Lower Game

**Higher Lower Game** is a simple console-based Python game 
where you try to guess who has more followers on Instagram.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

- Two famous people or brands are randomly chosen from a dataset.
- You see a short description of each and must guess who has **more followers**.
- If you're right, your score increases and the game continues.
- If you're wrong, the game ends and your final score is displayed.
